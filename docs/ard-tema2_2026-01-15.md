## 1. Context

**Business Requirements** - develop a software system that:

1. Collects data about patients: medical records, test results, admission forms, etc.
2. Collects data from medical equipment used for investigations.
3. The data is accessible to patients through a web application.
4. Doctors and authorized personnel have access to the data of patients admitted to the hospitals where they work.
5. The system allows for alerting medical staff when monitoring systems detect abnormal values.
6. The system can be sold to various healthcare companies and facilitates the transfer of patients from one to another.

### Scope

[//]: # (<< What is the problem we are trying to solve >>)

#### Personas

1. **Patient**: Individual receiving medical care or treatment.
    - R3: Patients require access to their health data via a web application.

2. **Doctor**: Medical professional providing care to patients.
    - R4: Doctors require access to the data of patients admitted to the hospitals where they work.
    - R5: They need to receive alerts to respond quickly to patient needs.

3. **Support Staff**: Support personnel assisting in patient care (e.g. nurses).
    - R5: Medical staff need alerts for abnormal values in patient monitoring.

4. **Administrator**: Manager overseeing the healthcare operation.
    - R1: Administrators need to manage patient records effectively.
    - R6: They facilitate patient transfers and ensure proper data handling.

#### Use cases

###### Use Case 1 (Patient)

#### System boundary (context diagram)

External entities for the Pulse Patrol system:

- *Human Actors*
    - **Patient** - views personal medical history, test results, and treatment progress via the web portal
    - **Doctor** - accesses patient data within their hospital and receives critical physiological alerts
    - **Support Staff Member** - nurses/assistants who receive real-time alerts for abnormal patient monitoring values
    - **Administrator** - manages records, oversees data integrity, and initiates inter-company patient transfers
- *External Systems*
    - **Medical Equipment** - IoT devices and monitoring hardware (e.g., bedside monitors, ventilators) that stream
      real-time telemetry
    - **Legacy Hospital Systems** - existing legacy databases or EMRs where admission forms and historical medical
      records may reside
    - **External Healthcare Companies Peer** - systems belonging to other providers that receive or send patient data
      during a transfer

#### Deployable units (container diagram)

The system will be decomposed into the following functional deployment units / containers:

- **Web Portal**: Interface for Patients to view records and for Administrators to manage data.
- **Clinical Dashboard**: Specialized interface for Doctors and Support Staff to monitor live telemetry and patient
  data.
- **Patient Management Service**: Core logic for medical records, admission forms, and inter-company transfers.
- **Telemetry & Alerting Service**: Processes real-time data from medical equipment and triggers notifications for
  abnormal values.
- **Data Storage**: Centralized repository for structured medical records and time-series telemetry data.
- **Integration Gateway**: Handles communication with Legacy Systems, Medical Equipment, and Peer Healthcare Companies.
