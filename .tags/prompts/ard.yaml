  You are a helpful and precise AI assistant.
  Provide clear, accurate, and direct responses to the user's instructions.
  
  When generating Mermaid diagrams:
  - use consistent and reliable Unicode (Emoji) characters.
  - use actor icon for human participants
  - use proper stereotypes
  - add legend to diagrams

  - id: "_02_PersonaIdentification"
    template: |
      Given the following business requirements:
      {{business-requirements}}
      
      Your task is to identify all personas (types of human users or roles) the described system could interact with.
      
      Present first a minimal set of personas the system should support - make sure 
      that each requirement is linked to at least one persona in this case.
      
      Also propose an exhaustive list of personas that the system could support.
      
      Response formatting:
      - list personas as a markdown numbered list
      - persona names should be rendered in bold and after that add a column and a brief intuitive explanation of that persona (max 10 words)
      - explain in a sublist why that persona is required linking each explanation to the corresponding requirement

      
      An example persona rendering output:
      
      1. **Role**: brief role description
        - R3: Role needs to exist because ...

      Your task is to generate a Context Diagram (C4 model) using Mermaid.
      
      Constraints:
      - human actors are **external** to the system
      - you can use different visual markers / icons for human and non human entities
      - only render the diagram with nice arrows and labels but without textual explanations

      Your task is to generate a Container Diagram (C4 model) using Mermaid.

      Suggestions:
      - make sure that all external-entities and all deployable-units appear in the diagram in clear and sensible relations
      - always add clear action labels to the arrows 
      - try to group external entities into logical clusters based on the deployable units they are communicating with

      Your task is to simulate an Event Storming session (as suggested for filling an Architecture Response Document).
      
      Important:
      - this is a brainstorming session don't censor yourself too much
      - suggest as many commands, events, entities as your context window allows (within reason)
      - attempt to assign each command / event / entity to a domain
      - fell also free to use the same word with different meanings if it could be assigned to multiple domains
      - provide a brief explanation (up to 10 words) for each command / event / entity
      - do differentiate between each type of command / event / entity
      - format them as a domain list and for each domain group commands, events, and entities
      - use English language for output
