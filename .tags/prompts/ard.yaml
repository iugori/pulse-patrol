  - id: "_02_PersonaIdentification"
    template: |
      Given the following business requirements:
      {{business-requirements}}
      
      Your task is to identify all personas (types of human users or roles) the described system could interact with.
      
      Present first a minimal set of personas the system should support - make sure 
      that each requirement is linked to at least one persona in this case.
      
      Also propose an exhaustive list of personas that the system could support.
      
      Response formatting:
      - list personas as a markdown numbered list
      - persona names should be rendered in bold and after that add a column and a brief intuitive explanation of that persona (max 10 words)
      - explain in a sublist why that persona is required linking each explanation to the corresponding requirement

      
      An example persona rendering output:
      
      1. **Role**: brief role description
        - R3: Role needs to exist because ...

      Your task is to generate the most relevant use cases for each persona.
      
      Constraints:
      - make sure that all business requirements are covered
      - structure each use case using the following pattern: As a <type of user>, I want <some goal>, so that <some reason/benefit>.

      - you can use different visual markers / icons for human and non human entities
      - only render the diagram with nice arrows and labels but without textual explanations
